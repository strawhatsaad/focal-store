            After we receive all necessary prescription and billing information,
            you can expect to receive your contact lenses in minimum 3 business
            days. Specialty contacts, including toric lenses and made-to-order
            lenses (e.g., Biofinity XR, Proclear XR), may take longer to arrive.
            In rare cases, due to manufacturing and supply chain issues, certain
            products may be on backorder‚Äîif that&apos;s the case, our CX team
            will reach out to let you know about the delay.

        >
          <p className="text-gray-500">
            You&apos;ll need a contacts-specific prescription to order your
            lenses. Here&apos;s why: Contacts sit directly on top of the cornea,
            while glasses sit at a distance away from the eyes, so prescription
            strength may differ between the two. Contacts have fixed
            measurements and variations determined by their manufacturers. These
            qualities can mean your prescription needs adjusting when it comes
            to the strength of your contact lenses vs. the strength of your
            glasses lenses. Contacts prescriptions include values that glasses
            prescriptions don&apos;t, like the base curve and diameter. Contacts
            prescriptions include a specific brand for your lenses.

        >
          <p className="text-gray-500">
            Yes, you&apos;ll need a contacts prescription specific to the brand
            you&apos;re purchasing. Because contact lenses are a medical device,
            and different brands have different features and measurements, the
            brand of lenses you order must be prescribed by your optometrist. If
            you ever want to switch brands or try a new one, just let your
            optometrist know or book an eye exam at one of our stores.

          <p className="text-gray-500">
            You&apos;ll need to provide an accurate, unexpired prescription
            before we can process your order. Your prescription must include the
            brand name of the lenses you&apos;re ordering, plus a doctor&apos;s
            signature. If you don&apos;t have your prescription on hand, we can
            contact your optometrist for a copy‚Äîjust enter their information at
            checkout.
